 * exception calls in case the test fails and a file is left renamed, not

	 * the copy and delete methods independently, this method tests the final

	 * that, because the methods that make up the cut method work that the final
	 * product will work.
	 *

	 * working correctly, but cut is not, they can know that the problem' cause
	 * is in how the cut method puts the two methods together.

	 * is private and needs to stay private, we cannot access this form of the
	 * paste method outside of the move method. This, in turn, means that we
	 * need to come up with a way of singling out the this part of the move
	 * method. This method tests the final result of the move method, but also
	 * functions as the test for that version of the paste method.
	 * 
	 * <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	 * of paste that it uses. After copying the file, this method shall call the
	 * compareFiles method to ensure that the contents of the files are the same
	 * before delete the original files. From there, this method shall delete
	 * the original files and make sure that they are deleted from the
	 * filesystem.
	 * 
	 * <p>Since the move method functionally consists of just a call to the
	 * special paste method for move followed by the normal delete method, if
	 * we test the delete method first and the testMove method fails, we can
	 * know that it is the paste method that has the problem.

	 * system shall attempt to move it back to prepare for the next call of
	 * this method.

	 * system shall also verify that the file was successfully replaced. Though

	 * still be checked.

	 * reason, the file will be made and then the test will be ran. With that

	 * difficulty in testing this in that the user may have changed what the
	 * defaults are. To fix this, we shall have a custom file "type" that is
	 * registered to be opened with some application that is guaranteed to be on
	 * any system. The only thing that fits this is JFiles itself, so this
	 * method shall use JFiles until further notice.
	 * 
	 * <p>To make sure the connection to the correct file is tested, this custom
	 * file type must be on the same configuration file that all of the other
	 * file types are on, but it must not be changeable by the user. To ensure
	 * this, the method that sets default programs for different file types
	 * shall check to see if the file type being changed is this custom type and
	 * prevent the user from changing this entry. Additionally, this entry must
	 * not be viewable by the user. This is a technical detail that we want to
	 * hide from the people using this API.
	 * 
	 * <p>Our other option is to make sure we have some other application is
	 * installed as a prerequisite so that we have something to test this
	 * method. For the sake of proper testing this may be wise, but this
	 * application should be small and take up as little space as possible
