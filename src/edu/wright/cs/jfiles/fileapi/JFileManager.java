/**
 * <p>This is the class that provides functionality for managing JFile objects. Examples of things
 * this class is in charge of will be copying, deleting, moving, renaming, and pasting JFiles.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It is the goal of this class to work as a medium of communication between <b>security</b> 
 * (such as authentication, authorization, and accounting), <b>maintenance</b> (such as logging),
 * <b>the GUI</b> (such as searching), and <b>JFiles</b>, by incorporating the methods of all of
 * these other APIs into the File API of JFiles.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This also exists to separate the methods involved with manipulating JFiles from an external
 * point of view from JFiles themselves. This is done so that a GUI or CLI can better make use
 * of the File API.</p>
