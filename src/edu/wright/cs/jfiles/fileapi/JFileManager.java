/**
 * <p>
 * This is the class that provides functionality for managing JFile objects.
 * Examples of things this class is in charge of will be copying, deleting,
 * moving, renaming, and pasting JFiles.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is the goal of this class to work as a medium of communication between
 * <b>security</b> (such as authentication, authorization, and accounting),
 * <b>maintenance</b> (such as logging), <b>user interfaces</b> (such as GUIs,
 * CLIs, and searching algorithms), and <b>JFiles</b>, by incorporating the
 * methods of all of these other APIs into the File API of JFiles.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In other words, this exist to both keep the duties of front-end and back-end
 * APIs separate by being a middle-ground for them to communicate. This also
 * means that the system can be more modular. For example, if a team wants to
 * create a new GUI, this system should be able to accommodate that. Likewise,
 * the same could be said for a different security API.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This also exists to separate the methods involved with manipulating JFiles
 * from an external point of view from JFiles themselves. This is done for both
 * logical and functional reasons. It may not make sense for a JFile to copy,
 * delete, or move itself. Creating the commands in this way also means that
 * this system can be modular.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is also important to note that this method does not hold JFiles. If there
 * is a need for such an object, a JFolder object will be made. This method is
 * not intended for instantiation, and, as a result, has no constructors. This
 * method just provides functions to unify different APIs.
 * </p>

	 * that the other is using, causing an error. The solution is to be found
	 * at a later date. The current theory to the solution is to have

		 * function differently for different OSs, so we will have to create a
		 * selection statement for different OSs. This has already been done.
