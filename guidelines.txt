1. Thoroughly comment on your code.
2. Try to avoid "sequential issuing" because it affects how much multiple members can get done at a time.
3. Commit messages should be meaningful/explanatory
4. Run ant clean test on code before pushing it
5. Keep up to date with what other teams are doing to avoid duplicates
6. If you couldn't solve a problem, note what still needs to be done with code.
7. Always reference the issue in your commit.
8. Commit early, commit often - keep your team up to date with what you're adding.
9. Document new methods on team wiki.
10. Show up to class to discuss state of project with team.
11. Issue descriptions should be detailed.
12. Make multiple smaller issues rather than a few large ones.
13. Watch out for buses. Doubly so if they're being driven by Roberto. Triply so if your name is Joshua.
